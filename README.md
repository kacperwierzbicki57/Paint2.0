# Mini Paint  
**Lightweight Sketching and Drawing Application**

Mini Paint is a portfolio-oriented project that delivers quick and intuitive drawing capabilities without the complexity of full-scale graphic design software. It is designed for rapid sketching, simple illustrations, and visual annotations, making it ideal for idea exploration, documentation support, and lightweight creative tasks.

This project focuses on clean design, extensibility, and clear user interaction while demonstrating solid programming fundamentals.

## 🎨 Core Features

- **Freehand Drawing**  
  Draw freely using a customizable brush with adjustable size, color palette, and opacity.

- **Shape Tools**  
  Create structured designs using built-in rectangle, circle, and line tools.

- **Text Annotation**  
  Add and style text directly on the canvas for labels, notes, or explanations.

- **Brush Control**  
  Fine-tune opacity and thickness for greater precision and control.

## 💻 Console C# Application

Mini Paint is implemented as a **C# console application**, emphasizing core programming concepts rather than graphical frameworks. This approach highlights logical design, command handling, and extensibility.

**Key Technical Aspects**
- **Command Pattern**  
  Menu-driven interface where user commands map cleanly to drawing actions.
- **Modular Architecture**  
  Well-structured, extensible codebase that allows new tools or features to be added with minimal refactoring.
- **Clear User Interaction Flow**  
  Predictable and easy-to-follow command-based controls.
